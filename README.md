<hr>

Enter the user and the wordlist, If you don't have wordlist you can use **wordlist.txt**, since it comes by default and has quite a few passwords in English. It is worth mentioning that if you want to use any wordlist own, you must add it to the directory where this repository is located.

After that, it will automatically try the quick login with the words of the wordlist. To run the script make sure you have installed everything, use this combination.

python3 spectrum.py
